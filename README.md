# Massive-Particle-Collision-Simulator

# Background
This was a personal project that I pursued to further my game development knowledge in Python. I began this project attempting to learn object oriented programming, since none of my coursework had touched on the subject. The result is a particle simulation that applies gravity to spawned particles that are able to collide with each other. *Note*, since this is a program written in python, it is poorly optimized and so any more than ~10 particles added will cause lag to occur. I thought about optimizing the program using a Quadtree class, however I never sought out the endeavor. 

### How to Run
The script was written within the Spyder IDE and uses the pygame library. After running the script a window will appear. __Hit spacebar__ and particles will spawn.
